# Spectro-Temporal Causality Analysis in Medical Time-Series

This repository contains the research code and methodological developments for the project *‚ÄúSpectro-Temporal Granger Causality in EEG/ECG Time-Series‚Äù*, conducted from November 2024 to August 2025 in collaboration with CNRS and the Max Planck Institute.

## üìå Project Summary

We develop and validate a novel framework for time‚Äìfrequency Granger causality analysis in multivariate biomedical signals. Our goal is to uncover causal interactions between cortical (EEG) and autonomic (ECG) activity during sleep, using high-resolution clinical data.

The proposed approach combines:
- Wavelet-based spectral decomposition,
- Multivariate Vector Autoregressive (VAR) modelling,
- Temporal and spectral formulations of Granger causality,
- Advanced time‚Äìfrequency visualization tools.

This project contributes to the study of brain‚Äìheart dynamics, sleep architecture, and possibly sleep-related pathologies (e.g. sleep apnea) through causal inference.

## üß† Data

We use full-night polysomnographic recordings from the **PhysioNet MGH Sleep Lab 2018** database. Each file contains:
- EEG (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, O2),
- ECG,
- Respiration,
- SaO2,
- Sleep stage annotations (every 30 seconds).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

- **Preprocessing**: bandpass filtering (0.1‚Äì40 Hz), artifact rejection, stationarity testing (ADF/KPSS).
- **VAR Modelling**: model order selection via AIC/BIC, fitted on 40s stationary windows.
- **Granger Causality**:
  - Temporal: using prediction error reduction,
  - Spectral: Geweke's decomposition over frequency bands,
  - Time‚Äìfrequency: wavelet-based nonparametric estimation.
- **Causal Metrics**: directional, instantaneous, and total causality matrices.
- **Visualisation**: causality scalograms, spectral maps, and phase-specific causal networks.
